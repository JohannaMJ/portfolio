# portfolio

This week's project was to build my own portfolio using HTML and CSS to display information about myself, my projects, skills, thoughts about code and contact information. The portfolio should work in different broswers and be accessible for people that experience disabilities. The portfolio will be changed continuously so that the most relevant projects are displayed.

## The problem

The project is built with HTML and CSS and has a responsive design. I started with the structure and features of the mobile version, then moved on to tablet and desktop. I did the cross-browser testing and audit/voice over of the website multiple times throughout the week and it worked out fine. I will make it a habit to test the accessibility further on when coding more advanced features.
It has been hard working with many layers of nesting and to get everything in place, but I am really satisfied with the result. Further on I will change the colours and hero image so that it fells more like me.
